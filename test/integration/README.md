# Test Requirements

* CouchDB is installed and running on your local machine: [Install](http://couchdb.apache.org)
* Create a new database called 'bos-couchdb-test' [See CouchDB guide](http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/tour.html)
* Ensure that there is no security to prevent you from sending GET and PUT requests to database 'bos-couchdb-test'
  * (this should be the default)
  * (you can use a command line tool like 'curl' to make requests)
